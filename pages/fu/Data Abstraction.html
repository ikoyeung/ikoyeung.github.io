                            <p>Programming in Java is largely based on building data types.
                                This style of programming is known as <em>object-oriented programming</em>,
                                as it revolves around the concept of an <em>object</em>,
                                an entity that holds a data type value. With Java's
                                primitive types we are largely confined to programs that operate on numbers,
                                but with reference types we can write programs that operate on strings, pictures,
                                sounds, or any of hundreds of other abstractions that are available
                                in Java's standard libraries or on our booksite.
                                Even more significant than libraries of predefined data types is that the range of
                                data types available in Java programming is open-ended, because you can
                                define your own data types.</p>

                            <ul>
                                    <li><em>Data types.</em>
                                        A <em>data type</em> is a set of values and a set of
                                        operations on those values.
                                    <li><em>Abstract data types.</em>
                                        An <em>abstract data type</em> is a data type whose internal
                                        representation is hidden from the client.
                                    <li><em>Objects.</em>
                                        An <em>object</em> is an entity that can take on a data-type value.
                                        Objects are characterized by three essential properties:
                                        The <em>state</em> of an object is a value from its data type;
                                        the <em>identity</em> of an object distinguishes one object from another;
                                        the <em>behavior</em> of an object is the effect of data-type operations.
                                        In Java, a <em>reference</em> is a mechanism for accessing an object.
                                    <li><em>Applications programming interface (API).</em>
                                        To specify the behavior of an abstract data type,
                                        we use an <em>application programming interface</em> (API),
                                        which is a list of <em>constructors</em> and <em>instance methods</em>
                                        (operations), with an informal description of the effect of each,
                                        as in this API for <code>Counter</code>:
                                        <p class="container--aligncenter">
                                            <IMG SRC="../../images/pages/fu/12oop/counter-api.png" alt="api for counter">
                                        </p>
                                    <li><em>Client.</em>
                                        A client is a program that uses a data type.
                                    <li><em>Implementation.</em>
                                        An implementation is the code that implements the data type specified in an API.
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </section>
                <section class="section">
                    <div class="section-container">
                        <div class="section-title">
                            <h2 class="">&sect;&nbsp;Using abstract data types.</h2>
                            <p>A client does not need to know how a data type is implemented
                                in order to be able to use it.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="section-content">
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Creating objects.</em>
                                    Each data-type value is stored in an object.
                                    To create (or <em>instantiate</em>) an individual object,
                                    we invoke a <em>constructor</em> by using the keyword <code>new</code>.
                                    Each time that a client uses <code>new</code>, the system
                                    allocates memory space for the object, initializes its value,
                                    and returns a reference to the object.
                                    <p class="container--aligncenter">

                                <li><em>Invoking instance methods.</em>
                                    The purpose of an instance method is to operate on data-type values.
                                    Instance methods have all of
                                    the properties of static methods: arguments are passed by value,
                                    method names can be overloaded, they may have a return value, and they may cause
                                    side
                                    effects. They have an additional property that characterizes them:
                                    <em>each invocation is associated with an object</em>.
                                    <p class="container--aligncenter">
                                        <IMG SRC="../../images/pages/fu/12oop/instance-method.png" alt="instance method">
                                    </p>
                                <li><em>Using objects.</em>
                                    Declarations give us variable names for objects that we can use in code.
                                    To use a given data type, we:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Declare variables of the type, for use in referring to objects
                                        <li> Use the keyword <code>new</code> to invoke a constructor that
                                            creates objects of the type
                                        <li> Use the object name to invoke instance methods,
                                            either as statements or within expressions
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        For example,
                                        <a href="Flips.java.html">Flips.java</a> is a
                                        <a href="Counter.java.html">Counter.java</a> client that
                                        takes a command-line argument <code>T</code> and simulate <code>T</code>
                                        coin flips.
                                    </p>
                                <li><em>Assignment statements.</em>
                                    An assignment statement with a reference type creates a copy of the reference
                                    (and does not create a new object).
                                    This situation is known as <em>aliasing</em>:
                                    both variables refer to the same object.
                                    Aliasing is a common source of bugs in Java programs,
                                    as illustrated by the following example:

                                    <blockquote>
                                        <div class="container">
<pre class="sourcecode">
Counter c1 = new Counter("ones");
c1.increment();
Counter c2 = c1;
c2.increment(); 
StdOut.println(c1);
</pre>
                                        </div>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    The code prints the string <code>"2 ones"</code>.

                                <li><em>Objects as arguments.</em>
                                    You can pass objects as arguments to methods.
                                    Java passes a <em>copy</em> of the argument value from the calling program to
                                    the method.
                                    This arrangement is known as <em>pass by value</em>.
                                    If you pass a reference to an object of type <code>Counter</code>, Java
                                    passes a copy of that reference. Thus, the method cannot change the original
                                    reference
                                    (make it point to a different <code>Counter</code>), but it can change the
                                    value of the object, for example by using the reference to call
                                    <code>increment()</code>.
                                <li><em>Objects as return values.</em>
                                    You can also use an object as a return value from a method. The method
                                    might return an object passed to it as an argument, as in
                                    <a href="FlipsMax.java.html">FlipsMax.java</a>, or it might
                                    create an object and return a reference to it.
                                    This capability is important because Java
                                    methods allow only one return value&mdash;using objects
                                    enables us to write code that, in effect, returns multiple values.
                                <li><em>Arrays are objects.</em>
                                    In Java, every value of any nonprimitive type is an object. In particular,
                                    arrays are objects. As with strings, there is special language support
                                    for certain operations on arrays: declarations, initialization, and indexing.
                                    As with any other object, when we pass an array
                                    to a method or use an array variable on the right hand side of an assignment
                                    statement, we are
                                    making a copy of the array reference, not a copy of the array.
                                <li><em>Arrays of objects.</em>
                                    Array entries can be of any type.
                                    When we create an array of objects, we do so in two steps:
                                    create the array, using the bracket syntax for array constructors;
                                    create each object in the array, using a standard
                                    constructor for each.

                                    of each possible value.

                                    A <code>String</code> is an indexed sequence of <code>char</code> values.
                                    <code>String</code> has dozens of instance methods, including the
                                    following:

                                    </p>
                                    <code>String</code> has special language support for initialization
                                    and concatenation: instead of creating and initializing a
                                    string with a constructor, we can use a string literal;
                                    instead of invoking the method <code>concat()</code> we can use the
                                    <code>+</code>
                                    operator.

                                    A disadvantage of the <code>StdIn</code>, <code>StdOut</code>, and
                                    <code>StdDraw</code>
                                    libraries of Section 1.1 is that they restrict us to working with just
                                    one input file, one output file, and one drawing for any
                                    given program. With object-oriented programming, we can define
                                    similar mechanisms that allow us to work with <em>multiple</em>
                                    input streams, output streams, and drawings within one program.
                                    Specifically, our standard library includes the data types

                                We implement ADTs with a Java class, putting the code in
                                a file with the same name as the class, followed by the .java extension.
                                The first statements in the file declare <em>instance variables</em>
                                that define the data-type values. Following the
                                instance variables are the <em>constructor</em> and the
                                <em>instance methods</em> that implement operations on data-type values.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Instance variables.</em>
                                    To define data-type values (the state of each object), we declare
                                    instance variables in much the same way as we declare local variables.
                                    There are numerous values corresponding to each instance variable (one
                                    for each object that is an instance of the data type).
                                    Each declaration is qualified
                                    by a <em>visibility modifier</em>. In ADT implementations, we use
                                    <code>private</code>,
                                    using a Java language mechanism to enforce the idea that the representation
                                    of an ADT is to be hidden from the
                                    client, and also <code>final</code>, if the value is not to be changed once
                                    it is initialized.
                                <li><em>Constructors.</em>
                                    The constructor establishes an object's identity and
                                    initializes the instance variables.
                                    Constructors always share the same name as the class. We can overload the name
                                    and have multiple constructors with different signatures, just as with methods.
                                    If no other
                                    constructor is defined, a default no-argument constructor is
                                    implicit, has no arguments, and initializes instance values to default values.
                                    The default
                                    values of instance variables are 0 for primitive numeric types,
                                    <code>false</code>
                                    for <code>boolean</code>, and <code>null</code>.
                                <li><em>Instance methods.</em>
                                    Instance methods specify the data-type operations.
                                    Each instance method has a return type, a <em>signature</em>
                                    (which specifies its name and the types and names of its parameter variables),
                                    and a <em>body</em> (which consists of a sequence of statements,
                                    including a <em>return</em> statement that provides a value of the return
                                    type back to the client).
                                    When a client invokes a method, the parameter values (if any) are initialized
                                    with client
                                    values, the statements are executed until a return value is computed, and the
                                    value is
                                    returned to the client.
                                    Instance methods may be <em>public</em> (specified in the API)
                                    or <em>private</em> (used to organize the computation and not available to
                                    clients).

                                <li><em>Scope.</em>
                                    Instance methods use three kinds of
                                    variables: parameter variables, local variables, and instance variables.
                                    The first two of these are the same as for static methods:
                                    parameter variables are specified in the method
                                    signature and initialized with client values when the method is called, and
                                    local variables
                                    are declared and initialized within the method body. The scope of parameter
                                    variables is the
                                    entire method; the scope of local variables is the following statements in the
                                    block where
                                    they are defined. Instance variables hold data-type values
                                    for objects in a class, and their scope is the entire class (whenever there is
                                    an ambiguity,
                                    you can use the <code>this</code> prefix to identify instance variables).

                                for reference and to set the stage for implementations

                                    A hallmark of object-oriented programming is that it enables us to
                                    <em>encapsulate</em> data types within their implementations, to facilitate
                                    separate development of clients and data type implementations.
                                    Encapsulation enables modular programming.
                                <li><em>Designing APIs.</em>
                                    One of the most important and most challenging steps in building modern
                                    software is designing APIs.
                                    Ideally, an API would clearly articulate behavior for all possible
                                    inputs, including side effects, and then we would have software to check
                                    that implementations meet the specification. Unfortunately, a
                                    fundamental result from theoretical computer science known as the
                                    <em>specification problem</em> implies that this goal is actually
                                    impossible to achieve. There are numerous potential pitfalls
                                    when designing an API:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Too hard to implement, making it difficult or impossible to
                                            develop.
                                        <li> Too hard to use, leading to complicated client code.
                                        <li> Too narrow, omitting methods that clients need.
                                        <li> Too wide, including a large number of methods not needed
                                            by any client.
                                        <li> Too general, providing no useful abstractions.
                                        <li> Too specific, providing an abstraction so diffuse as to be useless.
                                        <li> Too dependent on a particular representation, therefore not
                                            freeing client code from the details of the representation.
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        In summary, provide to clients the methods they need and no others.
                                    </p>
                                <li><em>Algorithms and ADTs.</em>
                                    Data abstraction is naturally suited to the study of algorithms, because it
                                    helps us provide a
                                    framework within which we can precisely specify both what an algorithm needs to
                                    accomplish and
                                    how a client can make use of an algorithm.
                                    For example, our allowlisting example at the beginning of
                                    the chapter is naturally cast as an ADT client,
                                    based on the following operations:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Construct a SET from an array of given values.
                                        <li> Determine whether a given value is in the set.
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        These operations are encapsulated in

                                <li><em>Interface inheritance.</em>
                                    Java provides language support for defining relationships among objects,
                                    known as <em>inheritance</em>.
                                    The first inheritance mechanism that we consider is known as <em>subtyping</em>,
                                    which allows us to specify a relationship between otherwise unrelated
                                    classes by specifying in an <em>interface</em> a set of common methods that
                                    each implementing class must contain.
                                    We use interface inheritance for
                                    <em>comparison</em> and for <em>iteration</em>.

                                    </p>
                                <li><em>Implementation inheritance.</em>
                                    Java also supports another inheritance mechanism known as <em>subclassing</em>,
                                    which is a powerful technique that enables a programmer to change behavior
                                    and add functionality without rewriting an entire class from scratch.
                                    The idea is to define a new class (<em>subclass</em>)
                                    that inherits instance methods and instance variables from another class
                                    (<em>superclass</em>).
                                    We avoid subclassing in this book because it generally works against
                                    encapsulation.
                                    Certain vestiges of the approach are built in to Java and therefore unavoidable:
                                    specifically, every class is a subclass of
                                    <a
                                        href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html">Object</a>.
                                    <p class="container--aligncenter">

                                <li><em>String conversion.</em>
                                    Every Java type inherits <code>toString()</code> from
                                    <a
                                        href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html">Object</a>.
                                    This convention is the basis for Java's automatic conversion of one operand of
                                    the
                                    concatenation operator <code>+</code> to a <code>String</code> whenever the
                                    other operand is a <code>String</code>.
                                    We generally include implementations of <code>toString()</code> that override
                                    the
                                    default, as in <a href="Date.java.html">Date.java</a> and
                                    <a href="Transaction.java.html">Transaction.java</a>.
                                <li><em> Wrapper types.</em> Java supplies built-in
                                    reference types known as <em>wrapper types</em>,
                                    one for each of the primitive types:

                                    What does it mean for two objects to be equal?
                                    If we test equality with <code>(a == b)</code>
                                    where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are reference variables of the same
                                    type,
                                    we are testing whether they have the same identity: whether the

                                    are equal.

                                    whether the <em>data-type values</em> (object state) are the same.
                                    Every Java type inherits the method <code>equals()</code> from

                                    Java provides natural implementations both for
                                    standard types such as <code>Integer</code>,
                                    <code>Double</code>, and <code>String</code>
                                    and for more complicated types such as
                                    <a
                                        href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/File.html">java.io.File</a>
                                    and

                                        href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/URL.html">java.net.URL</a>.
                                    When we define our own data types
                                    we need to override <code>equals()</code>.
                                    Java's convention is that <code>equals()</code> must be an <em>equivalence
                                        relation</em>:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> <em>Reflexive</em>: <code>x.equals(x)</code> is true.
                                        <li> <em>Symmetric</em>: <code>x.equals(y)</code> is true if and only if
                                            <code>y.equals(x)</code>
                                            is true.
                                        <li> <em>Transitive</em>: if <code>x.equals(y)</code> and
                                            <code>y.equals(z)</code>
                                            are true, then so is <code>x.equals(z)</code>.
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition, it must take an <code>Object</code> as argument and satisfy
                                        the following properties.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><em>Consistent</em>: multiple invocations of
                                            <code>x.equals(y)</code> consistently
                                            return the same value, provided neither object is modified.
                                        <li><em>Not null</em>: <code>x.equals(null)</code> returns false.
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Adhering to these Java conventions can be tricky, as illustrated
                                        for <a href="Date.java.html">Date.java</a> and
                                        <a href="Transaction.java.html">Transaction.java</a>.
                                    </p>
                                <li><em>Memory management.</em>
                                    One of Java's most significant features is its ability to <em>automatically</em>
                                    manage memory. When an object can no longer be referenced, it is said to be
                                    <em>orphaned</em>.
                                    Java keeps track of orphaned objects and returning
                                    the memory they use to a pool of free memory.
                                    Reclaiming memory in this way is known as <em>garbage collection</em>.
                                <li><em>Immutability.</em>
                                    An <em>immutable</em> data type has the property that
                                    the value of an object never changes once constructed.
                                    By contrast, a <em>mutable</em> data type
                                    manipulates object values that are intended to change.
                                    Java's language support for helping to enforce immutability is
                                    the <code>final</code> modifier. When you declare a variable to be
                                    <code>final</code>,
                                    you are promising to assign it a value only once, either in an initializer
                                    or in the constructor. Code that could modify the
                                    value of a <code>final</code> variable leads to a compile-time error.
                                    <p><a href="Vector.java.html">Vector.java</a> is an immutable
                                        data type for vectors. In order to guarantee immutability, it
                                        <em>defensively copies</em> the mutable constructor argument.
                                    </p>
                                <li><em>Exceptions and errors</em> are disruptive events
                                    that handle unforeseen errors <em>outside</em> our control.
                                    We have already encountered the following exceptions and errors:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                            Thrown when an exceptional arithmetic condition (such as integer
                                            division by zero) occurs.

                                            Thrown when the Java Virtual Machine cannot allocate an object
                                            because it is out of memory.

                                    <blockquote>

                                <li><em>Assertions</em> are boolean expressions which verify assumptions
                                    that we make <em>within</em> code we develop.
                                    If the expression is false, the program will terminate and report
                                    an error message.
                                    For example, suppose that you have a computed value that you might use to
                                    index into an array. If this value were negative, it would cause an
                                    <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> sometime later.
                                    But if you write the code
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <div class="container">
<pre class="sourcecode">
assert index >= 0; 
</pre>
                                        </div>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    you can pinpoint the place where the error occurred.
                                    By default, assertions are disabled.You can enable them from the command line by
                                    using the <code>-enableassertions</code> flag (<code>-ea</code> for short).
                                    Assertions are for debugging: your program
                                    should not rely on assertions for normal operation since they may be disabled.
