                                Many applications require that we process items having keys in order,
                                but not necessarily in full sorted order and not necessarily all at once.
                                Often, we collect a set of items, then process the one
                                with the largest key, then perhaps collect more items, then process
                                the one with the current largest key, and so forth.
                                An appropriate data type in such an environment supports two operations:
                                <em>remove the maximum</em> and <em>insert</em>.
                                Such a data type is called a <em>priority queue</em>.

                                Priority queues are characterized by the 
                                <em>remove the maximum</em> and <em>insert</em> operations.
                                By convention, we will compare keys only with a <code>less()</code> method, 
                                as we have been doing for sorting. Thus, if records can have duplicate keys,
                                <em>maximum</em> means <em>any</em> record with the largest key value.
                                To complete the API, we also need to add constructors 
                                and a <em>test if empty</em> operation. 
                                For flexibility, we use a generic implementation with a generic type 
                                <code>Key</code> that implements <code>Comparable</code>.

                                The basic data structures that we discussed in 
                                <a href = "../13stacks">Section 1.3</a> provide us with four
                                immediate starting points for implementing priority queues.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Array representation (unordered).</em>
                                Perhaps the simplest priority queue implementation is based on our code for
                                pushdown stacks. The code for <em>insert</em>
                                in the priority queue is the same as for <em>push</em> in the stack.
                                To implement <em>remove the maximum</em>, we can add code like
                                the inner loop of selection sort to exchange the maximum item
                                with the item at the end and then delete that one, as we did with 
                                <code>pop()</code> for stacks.
                                Program <a href = "UnorderedArrayMaxPQ.java.html">UnorderedArrayMaxPQ.java</a>
                                implements a priority queue using this approach.
                                
                                <li><em>Array representation (ordered).</em>
                                Another approach is to add code for <em>insert</em> to move 
                                larger entries one position to the right, thus keeping the entries in the
                                array in order (as in insertion sort). Thus the largest item is
                                always at the end, and the code for <em>remove the maximum</em> in the priority queue
                                is the same as for <em>pop</em> in the stack.
                                Program <a href = "OrderedArrayMaxPQ.java.html">OrderedArrayMaxPQ.java</a>
                                implements a priority queue using this approach.
                                
                                <li><em>Linked-list representations (unordered and reverse-ordered).</em>
                                Similarly, we can start with our linked-list code for pushdown stacks,
                                either modifying the code for <code>pop()</code> to find and return the maximum or 
                                the code for <code>push()</code> to keep items in reverse order and the code for
                                <code>pop()</code> to unlink and return the first (maximum) item on the list. 
                            
                            </ul>

                                All of the elementary implementations just discussed have the property
                                that <em>either</em> the <em>insert</em> or the <em>remove the
                                maximum</em> operation takes linear time in the worst case.
                                Finding an implementation where <em>both</em> operations are guaranteed
                                to be fast is a more interesting task, and it is the main subject of this section.

                                The <em>binary heap</em> is a data structure that can efficiently support 
                                the basic priority-queue operations. In a binary heap, the items are stored in an array 
                                such that each key is guaranteed to be larger than (or equal to)
                                the keys at two other specific
                                positions. In turn, each of those keys must be larger than two more keys, and so forth. This 
                                ordering is easy to see if we view the keys as being in a binary tree structure with edges 
                                from each key to the two keys known to be smaller. 
                            </p>

                                <b>Definition.</b>
                                A binary tree is <em>heap-ordered</em> if the key in each node is larger than (or 
                                equal to) the keys in that nodes two children (if any). 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Proposition.</b> The largest key in a heap-ordered binary tree is found at the root.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can impose the heap-ordering restriction on any binary tree.
                                It is particularly convenient, however, to use a <em>complete</em>
                                binary tree like the one below.

                                A <em>binary heap</em> is a set of nodes with keys arranged in a 
                                complete heap-ordered binary tree, represented in level order in an array
                                (not using the first entry).
                            </p>

                                In a heap, the parent of the node in position k is in position k/2; and,
                                conversely, the two children of the node in position k are in positions 2k and 2k + 1.
                                We can travel up and down by doing simple arithmetic on array indices: to 
                                move up the tree from a[k] we set k to k/2;
                                to move down the tree we set k to 2*k or 2*k+1.

                                We represent a heap of size <em>n</em> in private array 
                                <code>pq[]</code> of length <em>n</em> + 1, with <code>pq[0]</code> unused and the heap
                                in <code>pq[1]</code> through <code>pq[n]</code>. We
                                access keys only through private helper functions <code>less()</code>
                                and <code>exch()</code>.
                                The heap operations that we consider work by first making a
                                simple modification that could violate the heap condition, then traveling through 
                                the heap, modifying the heap as required to ensure that the heap condition is satisfied 
                                everywhere. We refer to this process as <em>reheapifying</em>, or
                                <em>restoring heap order</em>.

                                    If the heap order is violated because a node's key becomes larger than
                                    that node's parents key, then we can make progress toward fixing the 
                                    violation by exchanging the node with its parent. After the exchange, the node is larger 
                                    than both its children (one is the old parent, and the other is smaller than
                                    the old parent because it was a child of that node)
                                    but the node may still be larger than its parent. 
                                    We can fix that violation in the same way, and so forth, moving up the heap until we 
                                    reach a node with a larger key, or the root.

                                practical considerations.

                                    It is not difficult to modify our code to 
                                    build heaps based on an array representation of complete 
                                    heap-ordered ternary or <em>d</em>-ary trees.
                                    There is a tradeoff between the lower cost from the reduced
                                    tree height and the higher cost of finding the largest of
                                    the three or <em>d</em> children at each node.
                                
                                <li><em>Array resizing.</em>
                                    We can add a no-argument constructor, code for array doubling in <code>insert()</code>,
                                    and code for array halving in <code>delMax()</code>,
                                    just as we did for stacks in Section 1.3.
                                    The logarithmic time bounds 
                                    are <em>amortized</em> when the size of the priority queue is arbitrary
                                    and the arrays are resized.
                                
                                
                                <li><em>Immutability of keys.</em>
                                    The priority queue contains objects that are created by clients but
                                    assumes that the client code does not change the keys
                                    (which might invalidate the heap invariants).
                                    
                                <li><em>Index priority queue.</em>
                                    In many applications, it makes sense to allow clients to refer to
                                    items that are already on the priority queue.
                                    One easy way to do so is to associate a unique integer index with each item.

                                We can use any priority queue to develop a sorting method.
                                We insert all the keys to be sorted into a minimum-oriented priority queue,
                                then repeatedly use <em>remove the minimum</em> to remove them all in order.
                                When using a heap for the priority queue, we obtain <em>heapsort</em>.

                                Focusing on the task of sorting, we abandon the notion of hiding
                                the heap representation of the priority queue and use
                                <code>swim()</code> and <code>sink()</code> directly.
                                Doing so allows us to sort an array without needing
                                any extra space, by maintaining the heap within the
                                array to be sorted.
                                Heapsort breaks into two phases: <em>heap construction</em>,
                                where we reorganize the original array into a heap, and the
                                <em>sortdown</em>, where we pull the items out of the heap in 
                                decreasing order to build the sorted result.

                                <li><em>Heap construction.</em>
                                    We can accomplish this task in time proportional to <em>n</em> lg <em>n</em>,by proceeding 
                                    from left to right through the array, using <code>swim()</code>
                                    to ensure that the entries to the left of the scanning pointer
                                    make up a heap-ordered complete tree,
                                    like successive priority queue insertions.
                                    A clever method that is much more efficient is to proceed from right 
                                    to left, using <code>sink()</code> to make subheaps as we go.
                                    Every position in the array is the root of a small subheap;
                                    <code>sink()</code> works or such subheaps, as well. If the two children 
                                    of a node are heaps, then calling <code>sink()</code>
                                    on that node makes the subtree rooted there a heap.
                                <li><em>Sortdown.</em>
                                    Most of the work during heapsort is done during the second phase, where
                                    we remove the largest remaining items from the heap and put it
                                    into the array position vacated as the heap shrinks.
                            </ul>

                                Sink-based heap construction is linear time.

                                Heapsort users fewer than 2 <em>n</em> lg <em>n</em> compare and exchanges to sort n items.

                                Most items reinserted into the heap during sortdown go
                                all the way to the bottom. We can
                                thus save time by avoiding the check for whether the
                                item has reached its position, simply promoting
                                the larger of the two children 
                                until the bottom is reached, then moving back up the heap 
                                to the proper position. This idea cuts the number of compares by a factor of 2
                                at the expense of extra bookkeeping.
