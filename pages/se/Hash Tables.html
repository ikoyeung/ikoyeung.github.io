                                If keys are small integers, we can use an array to implement a symbol
                                table, by interpreting the key as an array index so that we can store the value
                                associated with key i in array position i.  In this section, we
                                consider <em>hashing</em>, an extension of this simple method
                                that handles more complicated types of keys. We 
                                reference key-value pairs using arrays by doing arithmetic operations
                                to transform keys into array indices. 
                            </p>

                                Search algorithms that use hashing consist of two separate parts. The
                                first step is to compute a <em>hash function</em>
                                that transforms the search key into an array index.
                                Ideally, different keys would map to different indices. This ideal is generally 
                                beyond our reach, so we have to face the possibility that two or 
                                more different keys may hash to the same array index. Thus, the 
                                second part of a hashing search is a <em>collision-resolution</em> process 
                                that deals with this situation.

                                If we have an array that can hold M key-value pairs, then we need a
                                function
                                that can transform any given key into an index into that array:
                                an integer in the range [0, M-1].
                                We seek a hash function that is both easy to compute and uniformly
                                distributes the keys.

                            <li><em>Typical example.</em>
                                Suppose that we have an application where the keys
                                are U.S. social security numbers. A social security number such as
                                123-45-6789 is a 9-digit number divided into three fields. The first
                                field identifies the 
                                <a href =
                                "http://cpsr.org/prevsite/cpsr/privacy/ssn/ssn.structure.html/">geographical
                                area</a>
                                where the number was issued
                                (for example number whose first field are 035 are from Rhode Island and numbers 
                                whose first field are 214 are from Maryland) and the other two fields 
                                identify the individual. There are a billion different social
                                security numbers, but suppose that our application will need to process just a 
                                few hundred keys, so that we could use a hash table of size M = 1000. 
                                One possible approach to implementing a hash function is to use three 
                                digits from the key. Using three digits from the field on the right is
                                likely to be preferable to using the three digits in the field on the left
                                (since customers may not be equally dispersed over geographic areas), but a
                                better approach is to use all nine digits to make an int value,
                                then consider hash functions for integers, described next. 
                            
                                <li><em>Positive integers.</em>
                                    The most commonly used method for hashing integers is called 
                                    <em>modular hashing</em>: we choose the array size M to be prime, and, for any
                                    positive integer key k, compute the remainder when dividing k by M. 
                                    This function is very easy to compute (k % M, in Java), and is
                                    effective in dispersing the keys evenly between 0 and M-1.
                                
                                <li><em>Floating-point numbers.</em>
                                    If the keys are real numbers between 0 and 1, we might just 
                                    multiply by M and round off to the nearest integer to get an index
                                    between 0 and M-1.
                                    Although it is intuitive, this approach is defective because it gives
                                    more weight to the most significant bits of the keys;
                                    the least significant bits play no role. One way to address
                                    this situation is to use modular hashing on the binary
                                    representation of the key (this is what Java does). 
                                
                                <li><em>Strings.</em>
                                    Modular hashing works for long keys such as strings, too:
                                    we simply treat them as huge integers.
                                    For example, the code below computes a modular hash function for 
                                    a String s, where R is a small prime integer (Java uses 31).
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <div class="container">
<pre class="sourcecode">
int hash = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
    hash = (R * hash + s.charAt(i)) % M;
</pre>
                                        </div>
                                    </blockquote>
                                
                                
                                <li><em>Compound keys.</em>
                                    If the key type has multiple integer fields, we can typically mix them 
                                    together in the way just described for <code>String</code> values.
                                    For example, suppose that search keys are of type 
                                    <a href = "PhoneNumber.java.html">USPhoneNumber.java</a>,
                                    which has three integer fields area (3-digit area code), 
                                    exch (3-digit exchange), and ext (4-digit extension).
                                    In this case, we can compute the number 
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <div class="container">
<pre class="sourcecode">
int hash = (((area * R + exch) % M) * R + ext) % M; 
</pre>
                                        </div>
                                    </blockquote>
                                
                                <li><em>Java conventions.</em>
                                    Java helps us address the basic problem that every type of data needs 
                                    a hash function by requiring that every data type must implement a method called 
                                    <code>hashCode()</code> (which returns a 32-bit integer).
                                    The implementation of <code>hashCode()</code>
                                    for an object must be <em>consistent with equals</em>.
                                    That is, if <code>a.equals(b)</code> is true, then <code>a.hashCode()</code>
                                    must have the same numerical value as <code>b.hashCode()</code>.
                                    If the <code>hashCode()</code> values are the same, the objects may or may not be equal,
                                    and we must use <code>equals()</code> to decide which condition holds.

                                    Since our goal is an array index, not a 32-bit integer, we combine <code>hashCode()</code>
                                    with modular hashing in our implementations to produce integers
                                    between 0 and M-1 as follows:
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <div class="container">

private int hash(Key key) {
    return (key.hashCode() & 0x7fffffff) % M;

                                    The code masks off the sign bit (to turn the 32-bit integer into a
                                    31-bit nonnegative integer)
                                    and then computing the remainder when dividing by M, as in modular
                                    hashing.

                                    Client code expects that <code>hashCode()</code> disperses the keys 
                                    uniformly among the possible 32-bit result values.
                                    That is, for any object <code>x</code>, you can write <code>x.hashCode()</code>
                                    and, in principle, expect to get any one of the 2^32 possible 32-bit 
                                    values with equal likelihood. Java provides <code>hashCode()</code>
                                    implementations that aspire to this functionality for many common types
                                    (including <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Double</code>,

                                    you have to try to do it on your own.

                                A hash function converts keys into array indices.
                                The second component of a hashing algorithm is collision resolution: a strategy 
                                for handling the case when two or more keys to be inserted hash to the same index. A 
                                straightforward approach to collision resolution is to build, for each of the 
                                M array indices, a linked list of the key-value pairs whose keys hash to that index.
                                The basic idea is to choose M to be sufficiently large that the lists 
                                are sufficiently short to enable efficient search through a two-step process:
                                hash to find the list that could contain the key,
                                then sequentially search through that list for the key.

                                In a separate-chaining hash table with M lists and N keys, the
                                probability (under Assumption J) that the number of keys in a list
                                is within a small constant factor of N/M is extremely close to 1.
                                of N/M is extremely close to 1. (Assumes an idealistic hash function.)

                                Another approach to implementing hashing is to store 
                                N key-value pairs in a hash table of size M > N,
                                relying on empty entries in the table to help with 
                                with collision resolution. Such methods are called <em>open-addressing</em>
                                hashing methods.
                                The simplest open-addressing method is called <em>linear probing</em>:
                                when there is a collision (when we hash to a table index that is
                                already occupied with a key different from the search key),
                                then we just check the next entry in the table (by incrementing the
                                index). There are three possible outcomes:

                                differently. For separate chaining &alpha; is the average number
                                of items per list and is generally larger than 1. For open addressing,
                                &alpha; is the percentage of table positions that are occupied; it
                                <em>must</em> be less than 1. We refer to &alpha; as the <em>load factor</em>

                                Why does Java use 31 in the <code>hashCode()</code> for <code>String</code>?
                                
                                <li class = qa value = 1> 
                                It's prime, so that when the user mods out by another number, they
                                have no common factors (unless it's a multiple of 31). 31 is also a
                                Mersenne prime (like 127 or 8191) which is a prime number that is 
                                one less than a power of 2.
                                This means that the mod can be done with one shift and one subtract if the
                                machine's multiply instruction is slow.

                                is negative, and this would create an array index out-of-bounds error.
                                Surprisingly, the absolute value function can even return a negative integer.
                                This happens if its argument is <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code> because the
                                resulting positive integer cannot be represented using a 32-bit two's
                                complement integer. This kind of bug would be excruciatingly
                                difficult to track down because it would only occur one time in
                                4 billion! [ The String hash code of "polygenelubricants" is -2^31. ]
