                                A <em>perfectly balanced</em> 2-3 search tree (or 2-3 tree for short)
                                is one whose null links
                                are all the same distance from the root.

                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Search.</em>
                                    To determine whether a key is in a 2-3 tree, we compare it against
                                    the keys at the root: If it is equal to any of them, we have a search hit;
                                    otherwise, we follow the link from the root to the subtree corresponding
                                    to the interval of key values that could contain 
                                    the search key, and then recursively search in that subtree.

                                    To insert a new node in a 2-3 tree, we might do an unsuccessful search and then hook on the 
                                    node at the bottom, as we did with BSTs, but the new tree would not remain perfectly balanced. 
                                    It is easy to maintain perfect balance if the node at which the search terminates 
                                    is a 2-node: We just replace the node with a 3-node containing its key and the new key to be 
                                    inserted.

                                <li><em>Insert into a tree consisting of a single 3-node.</em>
                                    Suppose that we want to insert into a tiny 2-3 tree consisting of just a single 3-node.
                                    Such a tree has two keys, but no room for a new key in its one node. To be able to perform the 
                                    insertion, we temporarily put the new key into a <em>4-node</em>,
                                    a natural extension of our node type that has three keys and four links.
                                    Creating the 4-node is convenient because it is easy to 
                                    convert it into a 2-3 tree made up of three 2-nodes, one with the middle key (at the root), 
                                    one with the smallest of the three keys (pointed to by the left link of the root), and one 
                                    with the largest of the three keys (pointed to by the right link of the root).
                                    <p class="container--aligncenter">

                                <li><em>Insert into a 3-node whose parent is a 2-node.</em>
                                    Suppose that the search ends at a 3-node at the bottom whose parent is a 2-node.
                                    In this case, we can still make room for the new key while maintaining
                                    perfect balance in the tree, by making a temporary 4-node 
                                    as just described, then splitting the 4-node as just described, but then,
                                    instead of creating a new node to hold the middle key, moving the middle key
                                    to the nodes parent.
                                    <p class="container--aligncenter">
                                        <IMG SRC="../../images/pages/se/33balanced/23tree-insert3b.png"  alt = "Insert in a 2-3 tree into a 3-node whose parent is a 2-node">

                                <li><em>Insert into a 3-node whose parent is a 3-node.</em>
                                    Now suppose that the search ends at a node whose parent is a 3-node. Again, we make a 
                                    temporary 4-node as just described, then split it and insert its middle key into the parent. 
                                    The parent was a 3-node, so we replace it with a temporary new 4-node containing the middle 
                                    key from the 4-node split. Then, we perform precisely the same transformation on that node. 
                                    That is we split the new 4-node and insert its middle key into its parent.
                                    Extending to the general case is clear: we continue up the tree,
                                    splitting 4-nodes and inserting their middle keys in their parents until
                                    reaching a 2-node, which we replace with a 3-node that does not to 
                                    be further split, or until reaching a 3-node at the root.

                                    If we have 3-nodes along the whole path from the insertion point to the 
                                    root, we end up with a temporary 4-node at the root. In this case we

                                    The basis of the 2-3 tree insertion algorithm is that all of
                                    these transformations are purely <em>local</em>:
                                    No part of the 2-3 tree needs to be examined or modified other than the 
                                    specified nodes and links.
                                    The number of links changed for each transformation is bounded by a small constant.
                                    Each of the transformations passes up one of the keys from a 4-node to 
                                    that nodes parent in the tree, and then restructures links accordingly,
                                    without touching any other part of the tree.

                                    These local transformations preserve the <em>global</em> properties that 
                                    the tree is ordered and balanced: the number of links on the path from
                                    the root to any null link is the same.

                                The insertion algorithm for 2-3 trees just described is not difficult
                                to understand. We consider a simple representation 
                                known as a <em>red-black BST</em> that leads to a natural implementation.
                            </p>

                                <li><em>Encoding 3-nodes.</em>
                                    The basic idea behind red-black BSTs is to encode 2-3 trees by starting with standard BSTs 
                                    (which are made up of 2-nodes) and adding extra information to encode 3-nodes. We think of the 
                                    links as being of two different types: <em>red</em>
                                    links, which bind together two 2-nodes to represent 
                                    3-nodes, and <em>black</em> links, which bind together the 2-3 tree.
                                    Specifically, we represent 3-nodes 
                                    as two 2-nodes connected by a single red link that leans left.
                                    We refer to BSTs that represent 2-3 trees in this way as 
                                    red-black BSTs.

                                    One advantage of using such a 
                                    representation is that it allows us to use our <code>get()</code>
                                    code for standard BST search without modification.

                                    Given any 2-3 tree, we can immediately derive a corresponding red-black BST, just by 
                                    converting each node as specified. 
                                    Conversely, if we draw the red links horizontally in a red-black BST,
                                    all of the null links are the same 
                                    distance from the root, and if we then collapse together the nodes connected
                                    by red links, the result is a 2-3 tree.

                                    Since each node is pointed to by precisely one link (from its 
                                    parent), we encode the color of links in <em>nodes</em>,
                                    by adding a <code>boolean</code> instance variable color to our 
                                    <code>Node</code> data type, which is <code>true</code> if the link from
                                    the parent is red and <code>false</code> if it is black.
                                    By convention, null links are black.

                                    The implementation that we will consider might allow right-leaning red links or two red-links 
                                    in a row during an operation, but it always corrects these conditions before completion,
                                    through judicious use of an operation called <em>rotation</em>
                                    that switches orientation of red links. 
                                    First, suppose that we have a right-leaning red link that needs to
                                    be rotated to lean to the left.
                                    This operation is called a <em>left rotation</em>.
                                    Implementing a <em>right rotation</em>
                                    that converts a left-leaning red link to a right-leaning 
                                    one amounts to the same code, with left and right interchanged.
                                
                                <li><em>Flipping colors.</em>
                                    The implementation that we will consider might also allow a black parent to have
                                    two red children.
                                    The <em>color flip</em> operation flips the colors of the
                                    the two red children to black and the color of the black parent to red.

                                In a red-black BST, the following operations take logarithmic time
                                in the worst case: search, insertion, finding the minimum,
                                finding the maximum, floor, ceiling, rank, select,
                                delete the minimum, delete the maximum, delete, and range count.
