                                A <em>directed graph</em> (or <em>digraph</em>)
                                is a set of <em>vertices</em> and a collection
                                of <em>directed edges</em> that each connects an ordered pair of vertices.
                                We say that a directed edge <em>points from</em> the first vertex in the
                                pair and <em>points to</em> the second vertex in the pair.
                                We use the names 0 through V-1 for the vertices in a V-vertex graph.

                                    Two edges are <em>parallel</em> if they connect the same ordered pair of

                                <em>incident on</em> both vertices.

                                    A <em>subgraph</em> is a subset of a digraph's edges (and associated
                                    vertices) that constitutes a digraph.
                                <li>
                                    A <em>directed path</em> in a digraph is a sequence
                                    of vertices in which there is a (directed) edge
                                    pointing from each vertex in the sequence to its successor in the sequence,
                                    with no repeated edges.

                                    A directed path is <em>simple</em> if it has no repeated vertices.

                                    A <em>directed cycle</em> is a directed path (with at least one edge) 
                                    whose first and last vertices are the same.
                                <li>
                                    A directed cycle is <em>simple</em> if it has no repeated vertices

                                    if they are mutually reachable: there is a directed path from <code>v</code> to <code>w</code>

                                    A digraph that is not strongly connected consists of a set of
                                    <em>strongly connected components</em>, which are maximal strongly connected
                                    subgraphs.

                                The <em>transitive closure</em> of a digraph G is another digraph
                                with the same set of vertices, but with an edge from v to w 
                                if and only if w is reachable from v in G.
                            </p>

                                <a href = "TransitiveClosure.java.html">TransitiveClosure.java</a> computes the
                                transitive closure of a digraph by running depth-first search
                                from each vertex and storing the results.
                                This solution is ideal for small or dense digraphs,
                                but it is not a solution for the large digraphs we might encounter
                                in practice because the constructor uses space proportional to V^2
                                and time proportional to V (V + E).
